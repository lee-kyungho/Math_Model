# Mathematical Modeling and Simulation 

In this course, we study modern mathematical models arising from engineering, medicine, management science, and data science and use tools from optimization and machine learning to solve them.

Lecture plan:

[Week 1-3] Optimization. Linear and nonlinear programming and gradient descent.
Applications include resource allocation, portfolio optimization, and data fitting.

[Week 4-5] Dynamic programming and Markov decision process.

[Week 6-8] Linear dynamical systems and linear quadratic regulator.
Applications include inventory control, epidemic models, mechanical engineering, stock trading.

[Week 9] Shallow learning. Perceptron algorithm, support vector machine, logistic regression, and softmax regression.

[Week 10-13] Deep learning with deep neural networks. Feedforward neural networks, multi-layer perceptron, and convolutional neural networks.

[Week 14-15] Kernel methods, Radial basis functions, and interpolation.
Applications include Supervised learning and classification and deep learning based image processing.
