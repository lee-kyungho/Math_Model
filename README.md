# Study

This repository contains codes that I have written for study, research and homeworks for lectures I took. I also added some summary of the courses with an adequate link.

# 1. Advanced Studies in Industrial Organization

Course Link: https://sites.google.com/site/oyvindthomassen/io19

The goal of the course is to understand and implement Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes(Econometrica, 1995; henceforth BLP). This course not only introduced the theory of demand estimation and GMM and ways to implement GMM estimation in MATLAB, but also introduced empirical model for consuming a bundle of products such as consumer behaviors in a supermarket. 

# 2. Mathematical Modeling and Simulation 

In this course, we study modern mathematical models arising from engineering, medicine, management science, and data science and use tools from optimization and machine learning to solve them.

Lecture plan:

[Week 1-3] Optimization. Linear and nonlinear programming and gradient descent.
Applications include resource allocation, portfolio optimization, and data fitting.

[Week 4-5] Dynamic programming and Markov decision process.

[Week 6-8] Linear dynamical systems and linear quadratic regulator.
Applications include inventory control, epidemic models, mechanical engineering, stock trading.

[Week 9] Shallow learning. Perceptron algorithm, support vector machine, logistic regression, and softmax regression.

[Week 10-13] Deep learning with deep neural networks. Feedforward neural networks, multi-layer perceptron, and convolutional neural networks.

[Week 14-15] Kernel methods, Radial basis functions, and interpolation.
Applications include Supervised learning and classification and deep learning based image processing.
