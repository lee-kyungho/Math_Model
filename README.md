# Study

This repository contains codes that I have written for study, research and homeworks for lectures I took. I also added some summary of the courses with an adequate link.

1. Studies in Advanced Industrial Organization

Course Link: https://sites.google.com/site/oyvindthomassen/io19

In this course, I learned modern demand estimation method with practical implementation. The foremost goal of the course is to understand and implement Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes(Econometrica, 1995; henceforth BLP) by oneself. This course not only introduced the theory of demand estimation and GMM and ways to implement GMM estimation in Matlab, but also introduced empirical model for consuming a bundle of products such as consumer behaviors in a supermarket.
